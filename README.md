# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Projects** repository! This repo is a collection of projects demonstrating various applications of deep learning using popular libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. Each project is structured to cover key concepts and architectures in deep learning, ranging from simple artificial neural networks (ANNs) to more complex models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).



### Featured Projects
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Customer Churn Prediction**  
  A model predicting customer churn using an ANN.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To get started with any project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-projects.git
   cd deep-learning-projects
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Each project includes a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary Python packages. Use the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   You can either run the provided Jupyter notebooks or use the Python scripts to train and evaluate the models. For example:
   ```bash
   cd Project_Name
   jupyter notebook
   ```
